- Snippet 1

![Picture 1](labrep43.png)

Here are the output that are given by VScode for Snippet 1, that means in this case, the expected output for Snippet one should be: [`google.com, google.com, ucsd.edu].

With this information, we can create our test case for Snippet 1, which is shown below.

Here are the output that are given by VScode for Snippet 2, that means in this case, the expected output for Snippet one should be: [a.com, a.com(()), example.com].

With this information, we can create our test case for Snippet 2, which is shown below.

- Snippet 3

Here are the output that are given by VScode for Snippet 3, that means in this case, the expected output for Snippet one should be: [https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/cse-15l-spring-2022/schedule].

With this information, we can create our test case for Snippet 3, which is shown below.

After creating all the test cases needed, we can run these test in the two repositories.

Here are the results for running the tests in my own repository

And here are the results for running the tests in the repository that I reviewed.

![Picutre 1](labrep41.png)

As we can see here on the two results, all three tests failed for both of the repositories, for Snippet 1 and 2, both repositories ended up with different outputs, but neither of the repositories was able to print out the expected output, and both of the repositories had different output for both testcase for Snippet 1 and 2. However, as shown above, both repositories even failed to print anything for Snippet 3's test. My repository said that index is out of range for Snippet 3, and the repository that I reviewed shows that Snippet 3 markdown file is an invalid input.
