In order to do the following lab report, I manually edited my code so that it prints out all the links for the two different implementation of MarkdownParse.java

My implementation

Lab 9 implementation
![2](labrep52.png)

As we can see, the two implementation has different outputs for test-files/488.md and test-files/201.md, here are the two output in a closer look
